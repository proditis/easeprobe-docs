### EaseProbe JSON Schema

We have a JSON schema that can be used to validate your EaseProbe configuration. The schema can be found at [resources/schema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megaease/easeprobe/main/resources/schema.json).

The schema file can be generated at any time by running the following command:

```bash
$ easeprobe -j > schema.json
```

In order to use the schema with VSCode for validating your configuration, you need to install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) and add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megaease/easeprobe/main/resources/schema.json": [
      "/path/to/config.yaml"
    ]
  }
}
```
