# 5. Administration

### 5.1 PID file

The EaseProbe would create a PID file (default `$CWD/easeprobe.pid`) when it starts. it can be configured by:

```
settings:
pid: /var/run/easeprobe.pid
```

* If the file already exists, EaseProbe would overwrite it.
* If the file cannot be written, EaseProbe would exit with an error.

If you want to disable the PID file, you can configure the pid file to "".

```
settings:
pid: "" # EaseProbe won't create a PID file
```

### 5.2 Log file Rotation

There are two types of the log files: **Application Log** and **HTTP Access Log**.

Both application and HTTP access logs will be displayed on StdOut by default. Both can be be configured by the `log:` directive such as:

```
log:
file: /path/to/log/file
self_rotate: true # default: true
```

If `self_rotate` is `true`, EaseProbe would rotate the log automatically, and the following options are available:

```
size: 10 # max size of log file. default: 10M
age: 7 # max age days of log file. default: 7 days
backups: 5 # max backup log files. default: 5
compress: true # compress. default: true
```

If `self_rotate` is `false`, EaseProbe will not rotate the log, and the log file will have to be rotated by a 3rd-party tool (such as `logrotate`) or manually by the administrator.

```shell
mv /path/to/easeprobe.log /path/to/easeprobe.log.0
kill -HUP `cat /path/to/easeprobe.pid`
```

EaseProbe accepts the `HUP` signal to rotate the log.
