### 3.1 SLA Report Notification

EaseProbe supports minutely, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly SLA reports.

```
settings:
# SLA Report schedule
sla:
    #  minutely, hourly, daily, weekly (Sunday), monthly (Last Day), none
    schedule: "weekly"
    # UTC time, the format is 'hour:min:sec'
    time: "23:59"
```

### 3.2 SLA Live Report

You can query the SLA Live Report

The EaseProbe would listen on the `0.0.0.0:8181` port by default. And you can access the Live SLA report by the following URL:

* HTML: `http://localhost:8181/`
* JSON: `http://localhost:8181/api/v1/sla`

You can use the following URL query options for both HTML and JSON:

* `refresh`: (_HTML only_) refresh the page every given seconds (ex, `?refresh=30s` refreshes the page every 30 seconds)
* `pg` & `sz`: page number and page size (ex, `?pg=2&sz=10` shows the second page with 10 probers), default page size is `100`
* `name`: filter the probers that contain the value of name (ex, `?name=probe1` list the probers which name containing `probe1`)
* `kind`: filter the probers with the kind (ex, `?kind=http` list the probers with kind `http`)
* `ep`: filter the probers with the endpoint (ex, `?ep=example.com` list the probers which endpoint containing `example.com`)
* `msg`: filter the probers with the message (ex, `?msg=example` list the probers which message containing `example`)
* `status`: filter the probers with specific status, accepted values `up` or `down` (ex. `?status=up` list only probers with status `up`).
* `gte`: filter the probers with SLA greater than or equal to the given percentage (ex. `?gte=50` filter only hosts with SLA percentage `>= 50%`)
* `lte`:filter the probers with SLA less than or equal to the given percentage (ex. `?lte=90` filter only hosts with SLA percentage `<= 90%` )

Refer to the Global Setting Configuration to see how to configure the access log.

### 3.3 SLA Data Persistence

EaseProbe would save the SLA statistics data on the disk.

The SLA data would be persisted in `$CWD/data/data.yaml` by default. If you want to configure the path, you can do it in the `settings` section.

When EaseProbe starts, it looks for the location of `data.yaml` and if found, loads the file and removes any probes that are no longer present in the configuration file. Setting a value of `"-"` for `data:` disables SLA persistence (eg `data: "-"`).

```
settings:
sla:
    # SLA data persistence file path.
    # The default location is `$CWD/data/data.yaml`
    data: /path/to/data/file.yaml
```
